# Concurrent Programming Assignment Sets

This repository consists of all the assignment sets that have been issued through the course.

The purpose of each assignment set can be summarised as:

## Assignment Set 1

1. FIFO Pipe Library implementation (no lock based synchronisation)
2. Master - Slave concurrent job issuing and processing (spin lock implementation)
3. Multithreaded External Merge Sort (spin lock, tmp file implementation)

## Assignment Set 2

1. Binary Semaphore Wrapper Library (using System V semaphores)
2. Master - Slave concurrent job issuing and processing (binary semaphore implementation)
3. Bridge Crossing Problem (binary semaphore implementation, adjustable fairness factor)
4. Roller Coaster Problem (binary semaphore implementation)

## Assignment Set 3

1. Binary Semaphore Library (monitor implementation)
2. Master - Slave concurrent job issuing and processing (monitor implementation)
3. Bridge Crossing Problem (monitor implementation, adjustable fairness factor)
4. Roller Coaster Problem (monitor implementation)

## Assignment Set 4

1. Coroutines implementation
2. User Level Threads & Semaphores Library implementation (round robin based automatic switching)
3. Readers / Writers Problem (using aforementioned library)
